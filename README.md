# About The Project
For this project, I took the Seinfeld API, and the backend of a fellow Software Engineer, and built out a functional front end. This webpage allows you to interact with quotes from the hit show "Seinfeld". You also have the option to edit, delete, and add your own quotes as well.

# Built With
I used the following software to build out the frontend of this application:
        -React
        -JavaScript
        -HTML
        -CSS
        -Netlify
        -Axios

# Getting Started
To utilize this application, use the deployed netlify link to navigate to the webpage. In the "quotes" tab, you are able to interact with the quote of your choice by clicking on it. From there, you have the option to remove or edit that quote. If you wish to add your own Seinfeld quote, simply click the "new quote" tab, and fill in the required information. From there, it will be added to the main list of quotes on the "quotes" tab.

# Usage
This repository can be used for anyone trying to build out a functional application that allows you to interact and modify third-part api data. The api is interchangeable and a user can build out something similar with different data.
